This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It was my first go at React.js and it wasn't meant for a very public stage. Lots of it is old and broken. You'll need:

- Node 4.x
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run start`

You can have a look at the build straight from [this page](https://vibrant-bose-197cf1.netlify.com/) though.
